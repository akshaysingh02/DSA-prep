/*
Quick sort is another Recurssive algo in which we follow divide and conquer rule
Few features: Time: O(nlogn) for average case
                    O(n^2)   for worst case
                    In-place algo (constant space complexity)

/*
Despite have the worst running time of n^2 quick sort is pretty fast and efficient in practical secenarios.
worst case is always avoided by an randomised version of quicksort, randomised one give
us O(nlogn) with very high probability.
Quick sort is often the most efficient choice of the sorting alogorithm in practial 
secenario, the most sort() function provided to us in the different language  libraries 
are the implemntation of quick sort only
